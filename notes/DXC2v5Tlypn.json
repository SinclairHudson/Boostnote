There are also some notation shortcuts, so we don't have to write as much. \n!!! danger differentiation rules\nSometimes, the standard differentiation rules don't apply, resulting in a function that can't be evaluated at the point we need. In this case, we **must** use the formal definition of partial derivatives, to see if the partial derivative actually exists.\n!!!\n\n!!! danger partial derivatives\na function's partial derivative can exist at a point, while being discontinuous at that point! differentiable does not imply continuous in multiple dimensions!\n!!!\n\n![3c2b8d87.png](3c2b8d87-kl2t950i.png)\n\nImportantly, unlike in single-variable functions, differentiability does not imply continuity.\n\n![3ad6299a.png](3ad6299a-kl2t950i.png)\n\nSo this means, if you take derivatives with respect to x and y, as long as they are both continuous, the order doesn't matter. This extends to higher order derivatives as well.\n\nIf the $k$-th partial derivatives of $f$ are continuous, then we write\n$$\nf \\in C^k\n$$\nand say \"$f$ is in class $C^k$\".\n\n![634ec23d.png](634ec23d-kl2t950j.png)\n\nThe tangent plane is really just an extension of the linear approximation of the function.\n\nIn higher orders, the above notation gets tedious.\nIt's better to have everything in a dot product of vectors.\nSo the **gradient** is the vector of all the partial derivatives evaluated at $\\vec{a}$.\n\n![a90aba1a.png](a90aba1a-kl2t950j.png)\n\n","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/MATH237","data":{},"createdAt":"2020-05-27T13:25:42.114Z","updatedAt":"2020-08-10T14:06:40.996Z","trashed":false,"_rev":"WVSoc5Wv41R"}
