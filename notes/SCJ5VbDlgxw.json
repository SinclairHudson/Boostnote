So it's what you give up; the investment returns, the leasing income that you could have gotten from renting your property, etc.\n\n**Explicit Costs**: costs the firm actually pays. Payroll, rent, etc.\n\n**Conventional deprecation**: The fall in value of a firm's capital. Machines wear out, reducing their value.\n\n!!! note Accounting Profit\nTotal revenue minus explicit costs and conventional depreciation,  with revenue equalling quantity sold times price. This number is vital for tax purposes and such.\n!!!\n\n!!! note Economic Profit\n$\\text{total revenue} - \\text{total cost}$. Total cost is measured as the opportunity cost of production. This includes both explicit and implicit costs.\n!!!\n\nBut what is a firm's opportunity cost of production? Well, it's the sum of the cost of using resources:\n\n* Bought in the market\n* Owned by the firm (it's the implicit rental rate of renting the capital to yourself). You could have used the resources you owned elsewhere, or sold them.\n* Supplied by the firm's owner. The owner can contribute labour and not take a wage, in which case the opportunity cost is the wage of the best alternative job. The owner can also contribute entrepreneurship (which I guess is investment), in which case the profit they can expect to receive on average is called **normal profit**.\n\n\n**Normal Profit**: The cost of entrepreneurship to a firm (this is an opportunity cost of production).\n\nThis is defined completely differently in the real world. I think what it's trying to say here is that the profit of a firm is the entrepreneur's profit to take, and they probably will take it. So it's a cost to the firm.\n\n![4cb88ab8.png](4cb88ab8-kl2ssw84.png)\n\nThe firm uses economic accounting to influence a firm's decisions given the firm's constraints:\n\n### A firm's Decisions:\n1. What do we produce, and in what quantities?\n2. How do we produce it?\n3. How do we organize and pay our workers?\n4. How do we market our products, and how do we price them?\n5. What should we produce ourselves, and what should we just buy from others?\n\n### A firm's contraints:\n1. Technological constraints\n2. Information constraints (we don't know everything)\n3. Market Constraints (we're sort of at the mercy of the consumer)\n\n## Technological Efficiency\nIf it's impossible to produce a given good by decreasing any one input, holding all other inputs constant, then production is technologically efficient.\n\n## Economic Efficiency\nWhen a firm produces a given quantity of output at the least possible cost.\n\n## Information and Organization\n\n!!! note Command Systems\nWhat you would expect. It's how a firm organizes its people and its management.\n!!!\n\n!!! note Incentive Systems\nSystems in place to induce workers into performing in such a way that they maximize the firm's profit.\n!!!\n\nThe above two systems of organizing are often used in tandem. It's hard to create a rigid command system when the firm's work isn't that structured, so instead they use more incentives to get workers to work efficiently. These systems are all about the:\n\n!!! note The principal-agent problem\n\nThe problem of devising compensation rules that induce an agent to act in the best interests of the principal (the firm).\nThere are many different solutions to this problem, here are a few common ones:\n**Ownership**, which gives managers the incentive to maximize a firm's profits because it also maximizes theirs. This can be something like franchising, or even stock options.\n**Incentive Pay**, linking pay to performance or giving big proportional bonuses.\n**Long-Term-contracts**, which basically say that workers are guaranteed a job or retirement benefits if the company does well in the long-run.\n!!!\n\n### Busines Organization and Market Contexts\nThere are three types of business organization:\n1. Sole Proprietorship\n2. Partnership\n3. Corporation\n\n!!! note Sole Proprietorship\nA firm with a single owner who has unlimited liability, or legal responsibility for all debts incurred by the firm. These are like \"small businesses\", like what Darrell is running. Darrell gets all the profits, and he's taxed like the business profits are his income.\n\nPros:\nEasy to set up\nEasy (ish) to manage\nProfits are taxed just once\n\nCons:\nBad decisions are never reviewed\nThe owner risks it all\nThe firm dies with the owner\nThe cost of capital and labour can be high.\n!!!\n\n!!! note Partnership\nA firm with two or more owners who have unlimited liability. So the partners need to agree on a management structure and how to divide profits. Profits are taxed as if they were the personal income of the owners.\n\nPros:\nEasy to set up\nEmploy diversified decision-making\nCan survive a withdrawal of a partner\nProfits are taxed just once\n\nCons:\nDisagreement\nOwners are risking it all\nCapital is expensive.\n!!!\n\n!!! note Corporation\nOwned by one or more stockholders with limited liability, which means the owners have legal liability only for the initial value of their investment. So the personal wealth of the stockholders is not at risk if the firm goes bankrupt. You lose your investment, but you have no debt. The profits are actually taxed twice; once on firm profits, and again as the income taxes paid by stockholders (unless you have a tax-advantaged account or something).\n\nPros:\nLimited liability for owners\nLarge-scale and low-cost capital is available\nProfessional management (they're good at this stuff)\nLower costs for long-term labour\n\nCons:\nComplex management\nProfits taxed twice\n!!!\n\n\n\n### Market Types\n\n!!! note Perfect Competition\nMany firms and many buyers\nAll firms sell and identical product (think commodities)\nNo restriction on entry of new firms to the industry (?)\nBoth firms and buyers are well-informed about prices and products\n\nExamples include commodities.\n!!!\n\n!!! note Monopolistic Competition\nMany firms and many buyers\nEach firm produces similar but different products -- *product differentiation*.\nEach firm possesses an element of market power\nNo restrictions on entry of new firms\n\nExamples include pizza shops, clothing, cleaning services\n!!!\n\n!!! note Oligopoly\nA small number of firms compete\nThe products might be very similar or not so much\nThere are barriers to entry into the market\nFirms have to start using strategic behaviour models (game theory)\n\nExamples include automakers, brewers, boeing and airbus, etc.\n!!!\n\n!!! note Monopoly\nOne firm produces the entire output of the industry\nThere are no close substitutes for the product\nThere are barriers to entry that protect the sole firm.\n\nExamples aren't actually that common, but some examples include Bell Canada, Good universities, and local utility.\n!!!\n\n\n### Measures of Concentration\nThere are a few ways to tell what kind of market we're in:\n\n!!! note The Four-Firm Concentration Rato\nThe percentage of the total industry sales accounted for by the biggest four firms in the industry. We would find that between Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and Motorola, these firms probably have over $90$%  market share.\n!!!\n\n!!! note The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index\nThe square percentage market share of each firm, summed over the largest 50 firms in the industry. The largest this measure, the less competition there exists in the industry. In a monopoly, this number will approach 10 000, which is $100^2$.\n\n!!!\n\nBut of course, there are limitations of these concentration measures:\n1. **The geographical scope of the market**. If the product is in some way tied to the location, or it can't be transported, then different companies can experience less competition if they're separated geographically.\n2. **Barriers to entry and firm turnover**. If it's hard to enter a market, there will be less competition. However, barriers to entry have really come down in the past two decades because of worldwide shipping and the internet.\n3. **The correspondance between a market and an industry**. Markets and industry don't always line up perfectly. For example, people can travel by city transit, bikes, cars, trains, and planes. What about trucks, mini-vans, and SUVs. Should they be included in the car market? so of course it's not a perfect system.\n\n### Decision Time Frames\n\nThere's the short run and the long run.\n\n!!! note Short Run\nThe short run is a time frame where at least one factor of production is fixed. For example, what plant you're currently renting, and what capital you have. Usually, the only thing you can change in the short run is the quantity of labour.\n!!!\n\n!!! note Long Run\nThe long run is a time frame in which **all factors of production can vary**; we can pivot if we want to. These decisions are difficult to reverse. Things like switching what you produce, or laying off most of your workers. The long run involves **sunk costs**, which is the past expenditures of a firm in which whatever was bought can't really be flipped. They're unrecoverable costs. So really, they should not be relevant to a firm's decision making process. When they are, it's called the **sunken-cost fallacy**.\n!!!\n\n### Product Schedules in the short run\n**Total product** is the total output produced in a given period.\nThe **marginal product** of labour is the change in total product resulting from a one-unit increase in the quantity of labour employed.\nThe **average product of labour** is total product divided by quantity of labour employed. These can be represented as curves of course.\n![585c39c3.png](585c39c3-kl2ssw84.png)\n\nOf course, this can be graphed because we love graphs.\n![cc0ab632.png](cc0ab632-kl2ssw85.png)\n\n![1f4e6cf8.png](1f4e6cf8-kl2ssw84.png)\n\n\n![aacf26ed.png](aacf26ed-kl2ssw84.png)\n\nMarginal product is like the derivative of the TP curve.\n\nIn the beginning, there's increasing marginal returns. Many hands make light work.\nAfter a while, there's diminishing marginal returns - too many middle managers and those that don't do work.\n\n![5866aace.png](5866aace-kl2ssw84.png)\n\n### Short-Run Cost\nThere are three cost concepts, which correspond to three curves:\n1. Total cost\n2. marginal cost\n3. average cost\n\n$TC$ is the total cost of _all_ resources used.\n$TFC$ is the cost of the firm's fixed inputs. They don't change with output. Stuff like rent.\n$TVC$ the cost of the firm's variable inputs. These do change with output.\n\n$TC = TFC + TVC$.\n\n![29a06e73.png](29a06e73-kl2ssw83.png)\n\nThe TVC gets its shape from the TP curve. It's like the inverse. This is because labour is part of the costs, and usually the only thing we can change in the short-run. And remember, there's diminishing returns on labour. So our costs rise faster than our output. Up to a constant, these graphs are the same, their axes are just flipped.\n\n$MC$, **marginal cost**. is the increase in total cost that results from a **one-unit increase in total product**. it's the derivative of the $TC$. The marginal cost curve is a U shape. \n\nHere come a lot more acronyms lol.\n\nAverage fixed cost is the total fixed cost per unit of output.\n$$AFC = \\frac{TFC}{Q}$$\nAverage variable cost is the total variable cost per unit of output:\n$$AVC = \\frac{TVC}{Q}$$\nAnd then average total cost is the sum of the two:\n$$ATC = AFC+AVC = \\frac{TC}{Q}$$\n\n![74776709.png](74776709-kl2ssw84.png)\n\nHonly fonk. That's a complicated graph.\n\nAnyway, the $AVC$ and $ATC$ are U-shaped.\n\n![592da385.png](592da385-kl2ssw84.png)\n\nThere are a few things that can change the cost curves. \nA technology that makes us more efficient in output, cost curves shift downward.\nHowever, if tech requires more capital, then the average total cost curve shifts upward at lower levels of output, and downward at higher levels of output.\n\nOf course, if we have to pay workers more, or materials get more expensive, our costs rise.\n\nLikewise, a fall in price of our factors of production decreases our costs.\n\n### Long-Run Cost\n\nA firm's transition between short and long revolves around the commitments made by the firm.\n\nRemember, in the long run, everything is variable.\n\n!!! note Production Function\nA firm's production function is the relationship between the maximum output attainable and the quantities of both capital and labour.\n![d5502ec4.png](d5502ec4-kl2ssw87.png)\n\n!!!\n\n**Marginal Product of Capital** is the increase in output resulting from a one-unit increase in the amount of capital employed, holding constant the amount of labour employed. Remember, capital is the assets that can enhance one's power to perform economic work. This is machinery, usually. It's not land. Capital can be increased by human labour.\n\nThe long run average cost curve is made up of the **lowest ATC for each output level**.\n\nThe **long-run average cost curve** (LRAC) is the relationship between the lowest atainable average total cost and output when both the plant and labour are varied.\n\nConsider 1 knitting machine vs 2 knitting machines vs 3 vs 4. The ATCs are here:\n\n![b854176a.png](b854176a-kl2ssw85.png)\n\n![aebd7bfa.png](aebd7bfa-kl2ssw84.png)\n\n\n!!! note Minimum efficient Scale\nThe smallest quantity of output at which the long-run average cost reaches its lowest level.\n!!!","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/imported/ECON101-201","data":{},"createdAt":"2020-06-19T14:12:20.576Z","updatedAt":"2020-08-09T13:25:23.012Z","trashed":true,"_rev":"lz1ZOTtSYeu"}
