The median is $k = floor(\\frac{n}{2})$\n!!!\nSelection can be done with heaps, in $\\Theta(n+k \\log n)$. Median-finding with a heap takes $\\Theta(n \\log n)$.\n\n#### Can we select in linear time?\n![7a246980.png](images-kl2t94wt.jpg)\nYes.\n\n### Quick-select (related to quicksort)\n\nTwo subroutines:\n* `choose-pivot(A)`: Return an index $p$ in $A$. We use the **pivot value** to rearrange the array.\n* `partition(A,p)`: Rearrange $A$ and return pivot-index $i$ so that \n   1. the pivot-value $v$ is in $A[i]$.\n   2. all items before are $\\leq v$, and\n   3. all items after are $\\geq v$.\n\nNow, partition is pretty good, and a niave implementation just has us make 3 lists for less than, equal to, and greater than. However, `partition` can actually be done in place.\n\nThe basic idea is to swap the outer-most wrongly positioned pairs, and continue until our pointers are equal. This is attributed to **Hoare**.\n\n![e909d13e.png](e909d13e-kl2t951c.png)\n\n\n## Behold: Quickselect\n\n![6c27be20.png](6c27be20-kl2t951b.png)\n\nThe worst case here is $\\Theta(n^2)$.\nThe best case is $\\Theta(n)$, where the first pivot is the chosen one.\nIt really depends on choosing the pivot.\n\n---\n\nA **randomized algorithm** is one which relies on some random numbers in addition to the input.\nThe goal of these algorithms is to remove bad instances, just unlucky numbers.\n\nThe **expected running time** is $E[T(I,R)]$ where $R$ is random numbers.\n\nThis expected running time is defined as you would expect.\n\n![11651c60.png](11651c60-kl2t951a.png)\n\nWe usually design the algorithm such that all instances of size $n$ have the same expected running time. That way, the maximum runtime is also the average runtime... (how?).\n\nSo now let's just select a **random pivot** for QuickSelect.\nNow, the expected running time is $\\Theta(n)$.\n\n---\n\n## Quicksort\nTony Hoare papa bless.\n\n![59347dc2.png](59347dc2-kl2t951b.png)\n\nIt's actually pretty simple, and it can be done in-place.\n\nQuick sort has a running time $T(n) = \\Theta(n) + T(i) + T(n-i-1)$. (partition and then two recursive calls on the prefix and suffix of the array). \n\nThe worst case is $\\Theta(n^2)$, when the pivot is at the beginning or end for some reason.\nThe best case is when the pivot is right in the middle, which is $\\Theta(n \\log n)$.\nThe average case is also $\\Theta(n \\log n)$.\n\n![1c1ccff0.png](1c1ccff0-kl2t951b.png)\n\n![b14f6d44.png](b14f6d44-kl2t951c.png)\n\n![288fd56e.png](288fd56e-kl2t951b.png)\n\nThere's no way to get below $\\Theta(n \\log n)$ for sorting.\n\n#### The comparison Model:\nThere are only two things that can happen:\n1. Comparing two elements\n2. Moving elements around\n\nComparison models can be expressed as a decision tree.\n\n---\n\n## Non-Comparison-Based Sorting\nbasically cheating. assuming things. The general idea is to sort by individual digits.\n\n**Bucket Sort**\n\n![377c39f3.png](377c39f3-kl2t951b.png)\n\nBucket sort is wasteful because of the linked lists.\n\n![58252179.png](58252179-kl2t951b.png)\n\n![8785af18.png](8785af18-kl2t951b.png)\n\nMSD-Radix sort is the multi-digit generalization. It's very clunky\n\n![a9a66ee0.png](a9a66ee0-kl2t951c.png)\n\nLSD-Radix-Sort depends on the stability of count-sort.\n","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/CS240","data":{},"createdAt":"2020-06-06T21:09:51.586Z","updatedAt":"2020-06-07T20:56:58.500Z","trashed":false,"_rev":"wsm-nIutPUf"}
