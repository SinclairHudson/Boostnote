Of course.\n\n![c6104a64.png](c6104a64-kl2ssw8c.png)\n\nA mapping is said to be **one-to-one** (injective) iff $F(a,b) = F(c,d) \\implies (a,b) = (c,d)$ for all points.\n\nOne-to-one implies Invertible.\n\n![5553f451.png](5553f451-kl2ssw8b.png)\n\n![c8ffaae6.png](c8ffaae6-kl2ssw8c.png)\n\nRemember that a square matrix has an inverse iff its determinant is non-zero.\n\n![919543c4.png](919543c4-kl2ssw8b.png)\n\n![a385a241.png](a385a241-kl2ssw8b.png)\n\n![dfa2cb80.png](dfa2cb80-kl2ssw8c.png)\n\n---\n\nRemember that the determinant of a matrix made up of 2d vectors is the area o the parallelagram described by them. The Jacobian of the mapping F describes the extent F increases or decreases areas. For small areas, multiplying the area in $xy$ with the Jacobian gives a good approximation of the area in $uv$.\n\nThis idea also extends to 3D: the jacobian is like the approximate volume magnification factor.\n\n![1c2e3b70.png](1c2e3b70-kl2ssw8b.png)\n\n---\n\n## Constructing Mappings\n\nWhen working with multi-integrals, it's important to construct mappings that are invertable that transforms one region into a simpler region.\n\nBasically, look at the shape, then try to find **linear** equations $u=f(x,y)$ and $v=g(x,y)$ such that the boundaries of the parallelogram line up to a square. If the mapping is linear, that means that the linear approximation is  a perfect approximation. This means that multiplying the area by the jacobian will actually yeild the correct area in the mapped domain. or you could divide to go the other way.","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/imported/MATH237","data":{},"createdAt":"2020-07-14T18:57:37.152Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-16T19:38:50.690Z","trashed":true,"_rev":"WIvcAMFnyhf"}
