These trees are always balanced!\n\n1 nodes behave exactly like BSTs. 2-nodes have 3 children, 1 branch for less than both, 1 branch for between or equal to the two keys, and 1 branch for greater than both.\n\nThe leaves are nil, and aren't counted to the height.\n\n![051dd631.png](051dd631-kl2ssw8e.png)\n\n\n\n---\n\nAB trees, and B trees\n\nA generalization of the 2-3 trees.
