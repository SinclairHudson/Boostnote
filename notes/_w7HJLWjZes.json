This is critical for deep learning, as you know.\n\n![00e17ad3.png](00e17ad3-kl2ssw8g.png)\n!!! danger common mistakes:\nDon't be a __numpty__: evaluate the derivative first, then set s=0.\nAlso, the unit vector __must always be normalized__!\n!!!\n\nAnd we can calculate these directional derivatives in terms of partial derivatives:\n\n![c944292a.png](c944292a-kl2ssw8g.png)\n\n---\n\n![eae6b12b.png](eae6b12b-kl2ssw8g.png)\n\nThis is the money maker! Remember the property of the dot product:\n$$ \\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{y}  = ||\\vec{y}||||\\vec{x}||\\cos\\Theta$$\nWhich is maximized when $\\Theta = 0$. Alternatively, if we wanted to go down the slope, as is the case in gradient descent, we would choose $\\Theta = \\pi$, so $\\cos{\\Theta} = -1$ and the rate of change is just as great, but negative. Also, we could find the minimum rate of change by setting $\\Theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nAs we have an intuition for, the maximum rate of change is in a direction orthogonal to the level curve. This is formalized in the following theorem:\n\n![af0e4b18.png](af0e4b18-kl2ssw8g.png)\n\nWe way orthogonal and not perpendicular because we can be working in more than 2 dimensions:\n\n![10077c5a.png](10077c5a-kl2ssw8g.png)\n\nSo there's going to be a 3D surface, and the normal vector of that surface at a specific point is the Greatest Rate of Change vector.\n\nSo there's going to be a 3D surface, and the normal vector of that surface at a specific point is the Greatest Rate of Change vector.\n\n![6a83fc9d.png](6a83fc9d-kl2ssw8g.png)\n\nThe equation of the tangent plane of a surface is given by:\n$$f_x(a,b,c)(x-a) + f_y(a,b,c)(y -b) + f_z(a,b,c)(z-c) = 0$$\n","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/imported/MATH237","data":{},"createdAt":"2020-06-13T22:08:22.629Z","updatedAt":"2020-08-10T14:11:08.465Z","trashed":true,"_rev":"8EKrKWDDHO0"}
