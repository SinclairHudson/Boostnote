These aren't the same method.\nSo it has to be like this:\n```cpp\nclass Text: public Book{\n  public:               \n  Text &operator=(const Book &other) override{...}\n}\n```\nBut then we can pass something like a comic and have it converted into a text...?\nWe'll come back to this in a little bit.\n\nAnother solution:\nMake all superclasses **abstract**:\n\n@startuml\nabstract class Book\nBook <|-- Text\nBook <|-- Comic\n\n@enduml\n\n---\n```cpp\nclass AbstractBook{\n  protected:\n    AbstractBook &operator=(const AbstractBook &other){...} //non-virtual\n    virtual ~AbstractBook()=0; //you must give this destructor an implementation.\n    .....\n};\n\nclass Text:publicAbstractBook{\n  public:\n  Text &operator=(const Text &other){\n    AbstractBook::operator=(other);\n    topic = other.topic;\n  }\n};\n```\nso now, `operator=` is non-virtual, so there's no mixed assignment.\n`AbstractBook::operator=` not accessible to outsiders, `*b1=*b2` won't even compile now. No partial assignment.\n","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/CS246E","data":{},"createdAt":"2019-10-29T14:40:44.015Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-05T21:35:01.867Z","trashed":false,"_rev":"4TNoWKffzuw"}
