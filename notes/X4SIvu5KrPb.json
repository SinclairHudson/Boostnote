They map from $R^n \\rightarrow R$. Now we'll look at **vector-valued functions**, which maps $R^n \\rightarrow R^m$.\n\n!!! abstract Mapping\n\nA vector-valued function whoese domain is a subset of $R^n$ and whose codomain is a subset of $R^m$ is called a **mapping**.\n!!!\n\nWe can use individual functions to specify the coordinates of a point in the codomain, based on inputs that are the point in the domain. These functions are called **component functions**. For example, if $F(x,y) = (f(x,y),g(x,y))$, then $f, g$ are component functions.\n\nIf a mapping $F$ acts on a curve $C$ in its domain, $F(C)$ is called the **image of $C$ under $F$**.\n\n![44f3babc.png](44f3babc-kl2sswa6.png)\n\nSimilarly, if $F$ acts on any subset $S$ in the domain, $F(S)$ is called the **image of $S$ under $F$**.\n\n---\n\n## Linear Approximation of a Mapping\n\nConsider a mapping $F$ where $u = f(x,y)$, $v = g(x,y)$.\n\nAssume that $F$, and thus its partial derivatives, have continuous partial derivatives.\n\nWe can create a linear approximation for how small changes in the domain (from a point $(a,b)$) affect the position in the codomain. We can use partial derivatives, of course:\n\n![0c7ed0d7.png](0c7ed0d7-kl2sswa6.png)\n\n![e7a99627.png](e7a99627-kl2sswa7.png)\n\n\n![f0dafba0.png](f0dafba0-kl2sswa7.png)\n\nOf course, these ideas can be generalized to more dimensions. \n\nwe can have a function $\\vec{u}=F(\\vec{x}) = (f_1(\\vec{x}), ..., f_m(\\vec{x}))$.\n\n![b843d406.png](b843d406-kl2sswa7.png)\n\n![e6e655a0.png](e6e655a0-kl2sswa7.png)\n\n---\n\n## Composite Mappings and the Chain rule\n\nIt's time to get funky. \n\n![79a6fefb.png](79a6fefb-kl2sswa6.png)\n\n![a7596749.png](a7596749-kl2sswa7.png)\n\nThe proof of the above is pretty trivial; multiplying the matrices is like the chain rule in every entry.","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/imported/MATH237","data":{},"createdAt":"2020-07-12T01:37:28.635Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-13T17:01:36.346Z","trashed":true,"_rev":"_pbGiJxFT2u"}
