Up to this point we've been using the Cartesian coordinate system.\n\n### Polar Coordinates\n\nThe **pole** is like the origin - it's our reference point. Now, let $P$ be any point on the 2d plane. the ordered pair $(r, \\theta)$ is the polar coordinate of a point that has an angle $\\theta$ to the x axis and length $r$. $r \\geq 0$.\n\n![6ccf823c.png](6ccf823c-kl2t9517.png)\n\nWe can convert from polar to cartesian quite easily, with some simple trig. $r$ is the hypotenuse, and the side lengths are $x$ and $y$.\n\n![243dda4e.png](243dda4e-kl2t9516.png)\n\n!!! danger Quadrants\nBe careful when converting; the trig functions are periodic, so you need to be sure you get the quadrant right when converting between these two coordinate systems.\n!!!\n\nFunctions in the polar space get funky. A constant function in $r$ is a circle, while a constant function in $\\theta$ is a line.\n\n![35139e8f.png](35139e8f-kl2t9516.png)\n\n$r=\\frac{1}{2}\\theta$ is a spiral:\n\n![444c88aa.png](444c88aa-kl2t9517.png)\n\nWe can also use the equations of conversion of points to convert whole functions. This can get a bit tricky, but graphing helps.\n\n### Areas in Polar Coordinates:\nThis revolves around the area of circles, or slices of circles. $sectors$.\n\n![911d054f.png](911d054f-kl2t9517.png)\n\n### Area between curves in polar coordinates\n\nTo find the area between two curves, there's a simple algorithm. We can't just split it up into rectangles and triangles or whatever.\n\n!!! hint Algo for area between curves\nHere's the alg; it's kind of annoying because of the integration.\n1. Find points of intersections\n2. Graph the curves and split the regions into easy-to-integrate sections\n3. Integrate\n4. Profit\n!!!\n\n---\n\n## Cylindrical Coordinates\n\nThis is like polar, but 3D space. The third axis is called the **axis of symmetry**.\n\nThe coordinates are 3-tuples: $(r,\\theta,z)$ where $z$ is the height and $r, \\theta$ are polar coordinates.\n\n![9655cf4f.png](9655cf4f-kl2t9517.png)\n\nAnd past that, it's what you'd expect. You can specify functions, which are surfaces in $R^3$.\n\nTo convert from cartesian, convert the $x$ and $y$ coordinates to polar, and leave the $z$ as is.\n\n---\n\n## Spherical Coordinates\n\nThis is spice. We use an origin (or pole) $O$. A point $P$ in spherical is given by a 3-tuple: $(\\rho,\\phi,\\theta)$. \n$\\rho$ is the length of the line segment $OP$.\n$\\phi$ is the angle between OP and the **positive z axis**.\n$\\theta$ is the same as in polar coordinates: the angle between the positive x axis and the $projection$ of OP on the $xy$ plane.\n\n![9c1995fe.png](9c1995fe-kl2t9517.png)\n\n![595ccb38.png](595ccb38-kl2t9517.png)\n\nConversion is as follows:\n\n![161ab0d3.png](161ab0d3-kl2t9516.png)","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/MATH237","data":{},"createdAt":"2020-07-11T01:14:01.451Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-13T17:18:50.778Z","trashed":false,"_rev":"le3m7QtszO"}
