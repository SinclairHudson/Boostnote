So if you order something differently from me, the lines connecting the two same letters will cross.\n\n![](image-kk4pxssc.png)\n\nok, not that great.\n\n![](image-kk4sowxc.png)\n\nWe can use a mergesort-kind of technique.\n\nIn fact, we're really just modifying merge-sort. Don't just count the inversions, also sort. That makes it easier to count inversions.\n\n![](image-kk4st3t8.png)\n\n---\n\n![](image-kk4sugw5.png)\n\n![](image-kk5sokuv.png)\n\nExtract all points within the strip, in sorted y order.\n\n![](image-kk5sry2r.png)\n\n#### Summary\n![](image-kk5sxqwf.png)\n\nThere can be at most 8 in the blue region, because if there were more, then there would be a smaller solution than $\\delta$, on one side.\n\n![](image-kk5t2fp8.png)\n\nboth the sorts, and combinations, are $O(n\\log n)$.\n\n---\n\nThe length $n$ of an integer $a$ is $\\Theta(\\log{|a|})$\nIt's stored as an array of `unsigned long`.\n\n![](image-kkig9csb.png)\n\nSo let's look at the recurrence here.\n\n![](image-kkigig24.png)\n\nWe're doing more addition, but less multiplication.\n\n![](image-kkigkqu6.png)\n\n![](image-kkign1ne.png)\n\nMatmuls are very important in a lot of applications, so a lot of research has gone into these algs.\n\n![](image-kkigrwal.png)\n","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/CS341","data":{},"createdAt":"2021-01-20T00:53:32.279Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-29T15:52:47.432Z","trashed":false,"_id":"note:M1eQD3-fb","_rev":"43-90c098d72db69d668210a1326f2d9a96"}
