Double integrals work the same, but in 2D. Now, we subdivide into little areas instead of little sections.\n\nFirst, the single-variable calculus:\n\n![9221c09f.png](9221c09f-kl2ssw9y.png)\n\nAnd now, a \"Rienmann Sum\" in 2d.\n![b1353b84.png](b1353b84-kl2ssw9z.png)\n\n![ce548e0a.png](ce548e0a-kl2ssw9z.png)\n\n![4abe7141.png](4abe7141-kl2ssw9y.png)\n\nWhere a single-variable integral can calculate areas, a double integral can calculate volumes.\n\n![c12ec2e2.png](c12ec2e2-kl2ssw9z.png)\n\n![b925a62a.png](b925a62a-kl2ssw9z.png)\n\nAnd now, we have some pretty intuitive rules and inequalities:\n\n![aaef4785.png](aaef4785-kl2ssw9y.png)\n\n![e093fc21.png](e093fc21-kl2ssw9z.png)\n\n\n![14b6c98b.png](14b6c98b-kl2ssw9y.png)\n\n![46343a79.png](46343a79-kl2ssw9y.png)\n\n---\n\n### Iterated integrals\n\nThe basic idea here is to break up the double integral into two, single-variable integrals that can actually be computed.\n\n![0eb13c1c.png](0eb13c1c-kl2ssw9x.png)\n\nThe order in which you integrate is important; and sometimes only one will work.\n\nIt's also important to consider that we may have to decompose areas in order to actually integrate them. Take this for example:\n\n![baf33f2f.png](baf33f2f-kl2ssw9z.png)\n\nYou could split this into quarters, or find the volume of the outer circle and then the inner circle and find the difference.\n\n---\n\n## Change of Variable Theorem\n\nIn the previous units we saw how we can find areas more easily by deforming into a different coordinate system and then re-forming. For double integrals, this is called a \"change of variables\".\n\n![03674c81.png](03674c81-kl2ssw9x.png)\n\n![f8320ec9.png](f8320ec9-kl2sswa0.png)","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/imported/MATH237","data":{},"createdAt":"2020-07-20T14:53:08.994Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-20T16:45:03.528Z","trashed":true,"_rev":"ROAhcOye9dz"}
