Application view: what services does it provide?\n2. System View: what problems does it solve?\n3. Implementation View: how is it built?\n \n## Application view:\nOSs provide **abstractions** of the hardware for the software. `fopen`, `fclose`  \nIt also **isolates** running programs from one or the other.\n\n## System View:\nOSs **manages** resources available to the system.   \n\nThe OS is a concurrent, real-time program  \n:::note Concurrency \nmultiple programs/instructions running or appearing to run at the same time\n:::\n\n:::note Real-time\nprograms that must respond to events within specific timing constraints.\n:::\n\n:::note kernel\n\nThe operating sytem kernel is the part of the operating system that responds to system calls, interrupts and exceptions.\n\n:::\n\n:::abstract operating system\nA group of programs including the kernel, in addition to other related programs that provide services for applications.\nThings like task managers, bash interpretters, OpenGL.\n:::\n\n![](image-kjxaqkg2.png)\n\n![](image-kjxarthk.png)","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/CS350","data":{},"createdAt":"2021-01-14T20:01:32.759Z","updatedAt":"2021-01-20T20:06:50.184Z","trashed":false,"_id":"note:hQNxvmF2e","_rev":"45-23bcd5255cce1862782775eed6c36a38"}
