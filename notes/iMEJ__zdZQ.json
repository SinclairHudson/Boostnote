For example, if your input was always positive and your first weight was negative. Then, the result out of the ReLU would always be 0. But if it's always 0, it does not contribute to the loss function, meaning the gradient is 0. So the update is 0. So the weight never updates and the activation just sits there, wasting memory. You can run a test to see which activations are 0 throughout the whole dataset.\n!!!\n\n## GeLU\nGaussian Error Linear Units\n$$ GeLU(x) = max(0, x) $$\n\n## Swish\n[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05941.pdf)\n\nSwish was found by Google using an optimization approach.
