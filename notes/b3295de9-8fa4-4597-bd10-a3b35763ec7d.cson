  ## Module 3: Sorting and Randomized Algorithms
  
  !!! note selection problem:
  Given an array $A$ of $n$ numbers, and  $0 \\leq k < n$, find the element that _would_ be at position $k$ of the sorted array.
  Special case: **Median Finding** (finding the median). The median is $k = floor(\\frac{n}{2})$
  !!!
  Selection can be done with heaps, in $\\Theta(n+k \\log n)$. Median-finding with a heap takes $\\Theta(n \\log n)$.
  
  #### Can we select in linear time?

  Yes.
  
  ### Quick-select (related to quicksort)
  
  Two subroutines:
  * `choose-pivot(A)`: Return an index $p$ in $A$. We use the **pivot value** to rearrange the array.
  * `partition(A,p)`: Rearrange $A$ and return pivot-index $i$ so that 
     1. the pivot-value $v$ is in $A[i]$.
     2. all items before are $\\leq v$, and
     3. all items after are $\\geq v$.
  
  Now, partition is pretty good, and a niave implementation just has us make 3 lists for less than, equal to, and greater than. However, `partition` can actually be done in place.
  
  The basic idea is to swap the outer-most wrongly positioned pairs, and continue until our pointers are equal. This is attributed to **Hoare**.

  ## Behold: Quickselect

  The worst case here is $\\Theta(n^2)$.
  The best case is $\\Theta(n)$, where the first pivot is the chosen one.
  It really depends on choosing the pivot.

  A **randomized algorithm** is one which relies on some random numbers in addition to the input.
  The goal of these algorithms is to remove bad instances, just unlucky numbers.
  
  The **expected running time** is $E[T(I,R)]$ where $R$ is random numbers.
  
  This expected running time is defined as you would expect.

  We usually design the algorithm such that all instances of size $n$ have the same expected running time. That way, the maximum runtime is also the average runtime... (how?).
  
  So now let's just select a **random pivot** for QuickSelect.
  Now, the expected running time is $\\Theta(n)$.

  ## Quicksort
  Tony Hoare papa bless.

  It's actually pretty simple, and it can be done in-place.
  
  Quick sort has a running time $T(n) = \\Theta(n) + T(i) + T(n-i-1)$. (partition and then two recursive calls on the prefix and suffix of the array). 
  
  The worst case is $\\Theta(n^2)$, when the pivot is at the beginning or end for some reason.
  The best case is when the pivot is right in the middle, which is $\\Theta(n \\log n)$.
  The average case is also $\\Theta(n \\log n)$.

  There's no way to get below $\\Theta(n \\log n)$ for sorting.
  
  #### The comparison Model:
  There are only two things that can happen:
  1. Comparing two elements
  2. Moving elements around
  
  Comparison models can be expressed as a decision tree.

  ## Non-Comparison-Based Sorting
  basically cheating. assuming things. The general idea is to sort by individual digits.
  
  **Bucket Sort**

  Bucket sort is wasteful because of the linked lists.

  MSD-Radix sort is the multi-digit generalization. It's very clunky

  LSD-Radix-Sort depends on the stability of count-sort.
