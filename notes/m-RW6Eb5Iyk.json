{"_id":"note:m-RW6Eb5Iyk","title":"Unit 09: Critical Points","content":"# Unit 09: Critical Points\n\nIn single variable calc, we call $c \\in R$ a critical value of $f$ if $f'(c)=0$ or $f'(c)$ is undefined. These values are often used to find local extrema.\n\nA local maximum in multi-variable is exactly what you would think of:\nIn the neighbourhood around a local max, no other point yeilds a higher value of $f$. Likewise for min. Pretty obvious, but how do we find/prove these points?\n\n!!! note Theorem\nIf $(a,b)$ is a local max or min of $f$. then each partial derivative is either equal to zero or does not exist.\n!!!\n\nThis leads to the definition of a critical point:\n\n!!! abstract Definition\nA point $(a, b)$ in the domain of $f(x,y)$ is called a **critical point** of $f$ if:\n![82308da5.png](82308da5-kl2sswa6.png)\n!!!\n\nAll local maxima/minima are critical points, but not all critical points are local maxima/minima.\n\n![68dfad0e.png](68dfad0e-kl2sswa5.png)\n\n\n!!! note Definition: Quadratic Form\nA function $Q$ of the form\n$$Q(u,v) = a_{11}u^2+2a_{12}uv+a_{22}v^2$$\n\nwhere the $a$s are constants, is called a quadratic form on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n![4074fc75.png](4074fc75-kl2sswa4.png)\n\n![7ca2ce75.png](7ca2ce75-kl2sswa5.png)\n\n![a9586b89.png](a9586b89-kl2sswa6.png)\n\nRemember, in a matrix \n$$\nA = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\na & b \\\\\nc & d\n\\end{bmatrix}\n,\ndet(A) = ad - bc\n$$\n!!!\n\nBefore continuing, note that if we're close to a critical point $(a,b)$, $f_x(a,b) = 0 = f_y(a,b)$. This means that we can rearrange the second degree taylor polynomial as: \n$$ f(x,y) - f(a,b) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(f_{xx}(a,b)(x-a)^2 + 2f_{xy}(a,b)(x-a)(y-b) + f_{yy}(a,b)(y-b)^2)$$\n\nThe expression on the RHS is a quadratic form, with $u=x-a, yv=y-b$. The associated matrix is the Hessian matrix of $f$ at $(a,b)$:\n$$Hf(a,b) = \\begin{bmatrix} f_{xx}(a,b) & f_{xy}(a,b) \\\\f_{xy}(a,b) & f_{yy}(a,b) \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n![6ea3b25c.png](6ea3b25c-kl2sswa5.png)\n\n!!! caution Degenerate Critical points\nLmao degenerates. Ok I'm done.\nNote that the second partial derivatives test is inconclusive if the hessian matrix is semidefinite. In this case, we say that the critical point $(a,b)$ is degenerate. In order to classify the critical point, we need to find the sign of $f(x,y)-f(a,b)$ in the neighbourhood around $(a,b)$. Basically, if the neighbourhood contains positive and negative values, we have a saddle point. Else, if it only contains positive values, we've got a local min. Else, we've got a local max.\n!!!\n\n---\n\n### Quick review of single variable:\n\n![2879e70a.png](2879e70a-kl2sswa5.png)\n\n![ecdc4547.png](ecdc4547-kl2sswa6.png)\n\n\n### Now onto two variables:\n\n![9327e5d3.png](9327e5d3-kl2sswa6.png)\n\n![6e976980.png](6e976980-kl2sswa5.png)\n\n![6da7c831.png](6da7c831-kl2sswa5.png)","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/imported/MATH237","data":{},"createdAt":"2020-06-25T22:35:07.884Z","updatedAt":"2020-08-10T14:11:14.940Z","trashed":true,"_rev":"OVSGQGEynMY"}
