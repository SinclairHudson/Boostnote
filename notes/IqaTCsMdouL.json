This issue is called **covariate shift**.\nThe original Google batch normalization paper showed that models with batch norm converge in 7% of the time.","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/imported/ML","data":{},"createdAt":"2020-10-22T22:15:59.298Z","updatedAt":"2020-10-22T22:18:34.936Z","trashed":true,"_rev":"Puh5kAotNWK"}
