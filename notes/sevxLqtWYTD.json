So why don't we do this all the time? The drawback now is that redTurtle and greenTurtle are not related to each other. They don't share a parent anymore. So you can't store a mix of them in a container.\n\nYou could give Turtle a parent:\n```cpp\ntypename <typename T> class Turtle: public Enemy{~~~~~};\n```\nAnd then you could store Enemy pointers in the same array. But it can't access the draw method. So you could give Enemy a virtual draw method. Which would defeat the purpose.\n\n\n## INCOMPLETE","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/CS246E","data":{},"createdAt":"2019-11-26T15:35:50.138Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-26T15:51:20.444Z","trashed":false,"_rev":"jD47OeB8zK6"}
