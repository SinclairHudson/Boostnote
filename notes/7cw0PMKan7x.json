How much memory should we free when we free a pointer?\n\nSo we save space and save time. We don't have to hunt for a block of the right size, and there's no hidden size field.\n\nApproach: Create a pool of memory - an array large enough to hold n T objects:\n\nWhen a slot in the array is given to the client, it will act as a T objects.\nWhen we have it, it will act as a node in a linked list.\nStore an int in each slot - index(not a pointer) of the next free slot.\nStore the index of the first free slot.\n0| ->||1|2|3|4|...|-1|\n---|---|---|-|-|-|-|-|-\n\n\n~~ a bunch of things I don't want to draw out ~~\nAllocation and deallocation are both constant time and very fast.\n```cpp\ntemplate<typename T, int n> class fixedSizeAllocator{\n  union Slot{\n    int next;\n    T data;\n    Slot():next{0}{}\n  };\n  Slot theSlots[n];\n  int firstAvailable = 0;\n  public:\n    fixedSizeAllocator(){\n      for(int i = 0; i < n -1; ++i) theSLots[i] = i +1;\n      theSlots[n-1] = -1;\n    }\n    T *allocate() noexcept{\n      if(firstAvailable == -1) return nullptr;\n      T *result = &(theSlots[firstAvailable].data);\n      firstAvailable = theSlots[firstAvailable].next;\n      return result;  \n    }\n    void deallocate(void *item) noexcept{\n      int index = (static_cast<char *>(item) - reinterpret_cast<char *>(theSlots))/sizeof(slot);\n      theSlots[index].next=firstAvailable;\n      firstAvailable = index;\n    }\n};\n```\n\nAnd here's how you use it in a class:\n```cpp\nclass Student final{\n  int assns, mt, final;\n  static fixedSizeAllocator <Student, SIZE> pool; //how many slots do you want?\n  public:\n    static void *operator new (size_t size){\n      if(size!=sizeof(Student)) throw std::bad_alloc{};\n      while (true){\n        void *p = pool.allocate();\n        if(p) return p;\n        auto h = std::get_new_handler();\n        if(h) h();\n        else throw std::bad_alloc{};\n      }\n    }\n    static void operator delete(void *p) noexcept{\n      if(!p) return;\n      pool.deallocate(p);\n    }\n};\n\nfixedSizeAllocator<Student, SIZE> Student::pool;\n\n```\nExample main:\n\n```cpp\nint main(){\n  Student *s1 = new Student;\n  Student *s2 = new Student; //custom allocator\n  delete s1;\n  delete s2; //custom deallocator\n}\n```\n\nIn testing, this custom allocator and deallocator run twice as fast as the standard ones!\n\nWhere do s1 and s2 reside?\nIt's actually in the **static memory**. Remember we declared it `static`. It matters where `pool` lives. It's not the heap or the stack.\n\n* We use a union to treat a slot as both an int and a Tobj.\n  * This ensures that no memory is wasted on bookkeeping.\n  * alternative - use a struct instead of a union, and store the next undex adjacent to the T object.\n* Advantage of a union: no wasted memory\n* Disadvantage of a union: if you access a dangling T ptr, you can corrupt the linked list.\n```cpp\nStudent *s = new Student;\ndelete s;\ns->setAssns(~~~~~~); //will probably corrupt the list\n```\n\nSO, following dangling pointers can be **VERY** dangerous.\n\nWith a struct, the same issue exists, but the 'next' field is before the T obj pointed to by s, so you have to work hard to corrupt it.\nTo corrupt, you would have to do:\n```cpp\nreinterpret_cast<int *>(s)[-1] = ~~~~~~; //not something you do by accident...\n```\n\nUsing a union - if one of the fields has a constructor, you have to give the union a constructor - since it's a union, the cunstructor should initialize only one field.\n\nOn the other hand - if you are using a struct, you will have difficulty if T does not have a default constructor.\n\nExample:\n```cpp\nstruct Slot{\n  int n;\n  T data;\n};\n\nslot theSlots[n]; //can't do this if T has no default constructor!\n\n```\nAnd we can't do operator new/placement new because we're writing operator new!\n\nWorkaround:\n```cpp\nstruct SlotChar{\n  char arr[sizeof(Slot)];\n};\n```\nor, if we want to use unions:\n```cpp\nunion SlotChar{ //same as a slot \n  char dummy;\n  Slot s;\n  SlotChar():dummy{0}{} // we can initialize the char and avoid calling a constructor\n}\n```\nWhichever one we choose:\n```cpp\nSlotChar theSlotChars[n];\nSlot *theSlots = reinterpret_cast<Sot *s>(theSlotChars);\n```\n\n---\n\nWhy do we store indices in the linked list rather than pointers? Because they're smaller.\nInts are smaller than pointers on this machine.\nSo we waste no memory, as long as sizeof(T) >= sizeof(int)\nWe do waste memory if T is smaller than an int.\nCould use a smaller type than int, like a `short` or a `char`, however they do have a limit on how many items they can represent. \n\n---\n\nWhy is the class Student declared `final`?\nOur fixed-size allocator only works if all of our objects are the same size. So we can't have a sublcass, because that could **add fields and change the size**.\nAlternatively, we could check the size, and throw and exception if it is not the right size. However, this is a runtime check so it's not as good.\nAlternatively, we could get the derived class to have its own allocator.","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/imported/CS246E","data":{},"createdAt":"2019-11-28T15:47:32.227Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-03T15:45:23.953Z","trashed":true,"_rev":"-aOW_5ZrQtl"}
