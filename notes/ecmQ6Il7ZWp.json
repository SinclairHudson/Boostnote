The destructor will not run on partially constructed objects.\n\n```cpp\nclass C{...};\nclass D{\n  C a;\n  C b;\n  int *c;\n  public:\n    D(){\n      c = new int[10];\n      ...\n      if(~) throw something; //*\n    }\n    ~D(){delete [] c;}\n};\nD d;\n```\nAt \\*, the D object is not fully constructed. So **~D() will not run on d**.\nBut a and b are fully constructed, so their dtors will run.\n\n**So if a constructor throws, it has to be responsible for its own cleanup**.\n```cpp\nclass C{...};\nclass D{\n  C a;\n  C b;\n  int *c;\n  public:\n    D(){\n      c = new int[10];\n      ...\n      if(~){\n        delete []c;\n        throw something;\n      } \n    }\n    ~D(){delete [] c;}\n};\nD d;\n```\n\nWhat happens if a destructor throws?\nTrouble lol.\nBy default, the program aborts immediately.\nstd::terminate is called.\n\nIf you really want a throwing destructor, tag it with `noexcept(false)`.\nBut you really don't want a throwing destructor.\n\nYou can't have more than one active exception; the program will abort guaranteed. You can only play ball with one baseball I guess.\n","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/imported/CS246E","data":{},"createdAt":"2019-10-01T14:13:04.903Z","updatedAt":"2019-12-05T01:42:16.102Z","trashed":true,"_rev":"kgEIHAuUDLl"}
